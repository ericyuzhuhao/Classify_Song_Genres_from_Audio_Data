# Classify_Song_Genres_from_Audio_Data

The following project description was adapted from DataCamp (https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/449).

In this project, song genres (Hip-Hop or Rock) were classified using acoustic features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, and tempo. PCA was implemented for dimensionality reduction. The performance of logistic regression and decision tree classifiers were compared. To improve the performance of each classifier, the data was balanced by sampling an equal number of records in each class of song genres.
